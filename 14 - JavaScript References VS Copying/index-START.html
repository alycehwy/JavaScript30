    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!


    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',

    };
    // and think we make a copy:

    console.log(captain);
    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // the object ...spread
